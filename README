DESCRIPTION
    This plugin keeps track of karma ( perl++ or perl-- ) said on IRC and
    provides an interface to retrieve statistics.

    The bot will watch for karma in channel messages, privmsgs and ctcp
    actions.

  IRC USAGE
    *   thing++ # comment

        Increases the karma for <thing> ( with optional comment )

    *   thing-- # comment

        Decreases the karma for <thing> ( with optional comment )

    *   (a thing with spaces)++ # comment

        Increases the karma for <a thing with spaces> ( with optional
        comment )

    *   karma thing

        Replies with the karma rating for <thing>

    *   karma ( a thing with spaces )

        Replies with the karma rating for <a thing with spaces>

ATTRIBUTES
  addressed
    If this is a true value, the karma commands has to be sent to the bot.

            # addressed = true
            <you> bot: perl++

            # addressed = false
            <you> perl++

    The default is: false

  casesens
    If this is a true value, karma checking will be done in a case-sensitive
    way.

    The default is: false

  privmsg
    If this is a true value, all karma replies will be sent to the user in a
    privmsg.

    The default is: false

  selfkarma
    If this is a true value, users are allowed to karma themselves.

    The default is: false

  replykarma
    If this is a true value, this bot will reply to all karma additions with
    the current score.

    The default is: false

  extrastats
    If this is a true value, this bot will display extra stats about the
    karma on reply.

    The default is: false

  sqlite
    Set the path to the SQLite database which will hold the karma stats.

    From the DBD::SQLite docs: Although the database is stored in a single
    file, the directory containing the database file must be writable by
    SQLite because the library will create several temporary files there.

    The default is: karma_stats.db

    BEWARE: In the future this might be changed to a more "fancy" system!
